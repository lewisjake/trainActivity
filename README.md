# trainActivity
This app is designed to allow the user to see an up to the minute table of
train arrival times. Using moment.js and javascript, the app allows the user
to enter a train name, its destination, the time the first train is supposed arrive. Moment.js is used to convert the military time input and return a value
into minutes. The user is allowed to enter multiple trains and javascript writes to the html and stores them in a table. Firebase is linked to store the data the user inputs into a database for the devs use.
